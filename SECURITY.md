# Reporting a vulnerability

If you find something that can be treated as a security vulnerability, please do not use the issue tracker or discuss it in the public forum/channels, as it can cause more damage rather than giving real help to the ecosystem.

<!-- [TODO!: Change to a link] -->
Security vulnerabilities should be reported using [this contact email](mailto:jbashir52@gmail.com).
